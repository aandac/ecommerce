## 1. Design
### 1.1 Considerations
#### 1.1.1 Assumptions
<p>This project is designed for simple ecommerce application that run on any docker container. Mainly focused on three major use case scenario.</p>

* Publicly browse products
* Customers browse and purchase with one click checkout option
* Merchants can be able to add their products to the application

#### 1.1.2 Constraints
Amazon S3 and Image transformation API is required to run application.
#### 1.1.3 System Environment
Application backend components
* Spring Boot
* PostgresSQL
* Redis
* [TransformImgs](https://github.com/Pixboost/transformimgs) -> Open source image transformation library uses ImageMagick
* Amazon S3

### 1.2 Architecture
*Ecommerce application is a simple monolith single page application. Frontend application communicates with backend side on secured and public REST API.*

Application has 3 roles,<br>
* `ADMIN` - > Admin user to manage/browse API swagger documentation.
* `MERCHANT` - > User can add/modify products
* `CUSTOMER` - > Regular user type who can purchase products

#### 1.2.1 Backend
Two types of backend API is designed for application.<br>
* `/public/*` - > Public REST API for registration or browsing products that are no user required 
* `/api/*` - > Secured REST API for product or customer related resources that required `JWT` token at Authorization header.

For database version control [Liquibase](https://www.liquibase.org/) is used. All type of users are populated with it. 

To simulate Amazon S3 environment, [Localstack](https://localstack.cloud/) is used.
To reduce the size of the images, [TransformImgs](https://github.com/Pixboost/transformimgs) is used. It is a simple REST API version of [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php). 

[OpenAPI documentation](https://swagger.io/specification/) can be browsed at `http://localhost:8081/admin/swagger` which is generated by swagger.
Only `ADMIN` role user can be able to log in and test credentials are; 
```
admin@ecommerce.com

```

#### 1.2.2 Frontend
[CoreUI Vue Admin Template](https://github.com/coreui/coreui-free-vue-admin-template) is used for frontend of application. It has already built in components and offers production ready user experience.

## 2. Install

Browse in `setup` folder and run
```
docker-compose up --build -d
```



To stop application
```
docker-compose down
```
### 2.1 Delete & Refresh Data
[Localstack](https://localstack.cloud/) is using `localstack-data` in `setup` folder and delete to reset all images.<br>
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is using `postgres-data` in `setup` folder and delete to erase database.
